# Finding Land

Finding land in Costa Rica is no small task. The process is fraught with all kinds of dangers and deceptions. It's a little early in our story to begin detailing the negative aspects of Costa Rica, but, upon careful weighing of their proportion to the experience over here, perhaps now is the best time, at least the most just. There is an extremely devious trait in all business dealings in Latin America. Costa Rica has it great measure. If you want an example of what I am talking about, watch all three seasons of Narcos on Netflix, then watch all three seasons of Narcos Mexico. You will get the point. There is no judgment in this story, this documentation of the journey I undertook with my son to create a new life in another part of the world, no judgment whatsoever. When I look at a situation; when I look at the people; and when I look at a land; I ask myself if I would be any different if I had been born and raised in the situation, with the people, on that land. The answer is no. If the answer to the question is no, then by that answer alone I suspend all judgment. Over time you have to accept that this is just an aspect of the culture that is unavoidable. You have to have your guard up. There is no doubt about that. You have to watch every transaction like a predatory hawk five-hundred feet above farmland. You have to watch your lawyers. You have to watch your neighbors. You have to watch your laborers. You have to watch your business partners. You have to watch everybody in this country -- Costa Rica, the beautiful coast. It is just the way it is.

I have asked dozens of Ticos how the culture evolved this way. The answers range from complete ignorance -- meaning it is so embedded in them they cannot see it -- to erudite commentary, which almost always comes from a local who has lived outside Costa Rica for more than five years and possesses at the bare minimum a master degree in something or other. It was the Spanish, they say. The colonization of this part of the world was significantly more brutal than North America under the French and English. I have to admit, I am very understudied in Spanish history in the Americas. I am still trying to own up to the shame of what the English and French did in North America. I do, however, remember it was the Spanish who launched and sustained the Catholic Inquisition -- with the blessing of Rome, I assume -- and commenced what is probably the best documented terror campaign in history, finding highly inventive ways to torture the flesh, the mind, and the spirit, so I have some sense of why Latin America is such a cynical culture. When I was trying to describe it to friends back home in Canada and the United States, I used to say business happens this way here: ten partners meet somewhere around a large table; they all lay down a hundred bucks for the thousand dollars necessary to start the business; so there is the money, sitting on the table, and they toast to good fortune, and the first guy who leaves to go to the bathroom comes back to an empty table and the money is gone, and the nine other guys, friends of the tenth who went to take a piss, all go home having made eleven dollars and change on their business venture. So it goes. My analogy is really not that far off. The stories you here after seven or more years in this country reveal blatantly corrupt lawyers, judges, courts, police, and just about anybody else you could name by title. I am certainly not saying North America is any less corrupt, and more perfect, or in any way a sanctified place. Not at all, but all in good time. I am talking about Latin America right now. As my son and I unfold our story, you will find that I am even evenhandedly cynical, irregardless of culture, race, language, geography, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other thing. What can I say? I echo the sages and philosophers -- life is short, nasty, and brutish. This is a happy story, though, a minor cycle of the heroic journey, full of hope, love, laughter, adventure, and all the good things that offset the nasty and brutish stuff.

contracted with the brother of a friend I knew in the Central Valley. My first introduction to Costa Rica was the Central Valley. This is where a lot of North American settle, were they used to settle in the Central Valley. Guanacaste province in Tamarindo in particular have become favorites now oh, but the whole demographic has changed. The people who come to Costa Rica are different now. When I first started coming to Costa Rica in 2001 in my early 30s most of the people you met over here from North America we're retired for single men. Costa Rica had built quite a reputation as a national brothel. Prostitution had been legalized by the very liberal government and many single men came here for sex tourism. My introduction to the country was through him. He had married a Costa Rican and had two children but he continued business in Canada. I like the way you moved around the world and it seemed very Cosmopolitan to me. Brandon was only three years old when I first visited Costa Rica. His mother and I had already divorced. The wound was still quite fresh back then. Costa Rica was a place I could go and just forget about everything. It was so intoxicating.

It was here in the central Valley that I visited a couple more times. A Danish to be specific. It had gained International repute because National Geographic had named it the most favorable climate for human beings in the world. It really did have a beautiful climate. Perfect for human health and habitation. Many parts of Costa Rica are such that you require no heat and no air conditioning. It's literally a perfect human environment for living 12-months a year. All of these locations are elevated. They are in the mountains. Down around the beaches it's a sauna. You have to have a high tolerance for heat and humidity to live down by the beach. Many people who come here think they want the beach life but sell their property or move from their rented home after one year, realizing the beach is not that much fun all year-round year in and year out. It was in the Central Valley that I made my first group of Connections in Costa Rica, both Costa Rican and North American. It was from this fool that I drew when I came here to buy land and build my own home. My friend's brother lived in the province of the mon in the mon had been selected because it had the lowest prices for land in the country. There are a lot of reasons for that but we're not going to get into them now. That will come more as we get into the experience of living in the most, later in the story. This was one of my first business dealings in Costa Rica, the contract with my friend's brother to find the land. I offered him a fine permit percent commission on whatever he found. This was a very bad idea. He disregarded all of my instructions for finding land and deliberately selected Parcels that were well in excess of what my budget was. This, of course, was to boost his commission. You will find this kind of behavior rampant in Costa Rica. It's just not a place where you can do business the way you do business in North America or Western Europe. The market isn't mature enough and everybody is looking for a quick score. I suppose this comes from generations of working the land does peasant Farmers, what they call campesinos here and I do feel for it, but at the same time, from the perspective of a North American Consumer, it is downright infuriating.

The next thing I noticed when I contracted with the Costa Rican gentleman to find me a parcel of land was the social nepotism. People did not do business in Costa Rica outside of the people they knew. They didn't use classified ads. They didn't go to any land registry or sale sites that a North American would go to. They simply went to the people they knew in the region and asked who was selling land. They then made it known that they were acting as agent for a North American. Immediately upon saying that the price is double or triple. I looked at two or three Parcels of land through my friend's brother. It was extremely frustrating. In one instance the land didn't have a single characteristic from the list of attributes that I had asked 4\. It was in a remote area that had no easement, no access to the land. It didn't have water readily available. I didn't want to drill a well. He did on the third go managed to find a hectare of land that I really liked that was at the lower part of the mountain I now live on. Upon doing my due diligence I found that the seller had a lien on the land and was trying to rob me. Was at that point that I terminated the relationship with my friend's brother. The bitterness that ensued from this termination lasted a couple of years in which he tried everything possible to extort for get the money from me that he missed from not detaining the commission for finding a proper parcel of land. This is another aspect of business in Costa Rica. It was you contract with people you're going to have to pay them whether they do what you ask them to do or not. It's kind of an attitude where I showed up and you owe me money. It doesn't matter that they didn't fulfill any of the instructions that you gave to them. They showed up. You owe money. As you migrate into this country you will hear countless stories like this. Some of you listening to this right now as you sit back and read this story probably are attributing the fault to me in some way shape or form. It must have been something that I did. It must have been the way I interacted with the country. It must have been the way I interacted with the people. You think in your smugness and your lack of experience that you will be able to circumvent these cultural problems. You will not. You will experience everything I experienced and everything that every other Foreigner from North America has experienced when they come down here and try to buy a parcel of land or get a house built. And this is just stage one I'm talking about. I'm not even talking about getting the land registered getting the plans into the municipal registry, and all of these sorts of things. My story is mild because I didn't come with a lot of money. North Americans who come here with hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on a home, a parcel of land, or even a Mountaintop, as Mel Gibson brought bought some years ago, haven't even tougher go of it than me, and in many instances all they do is enter into a more dangerous shark feeding ground with the more predacious of Costa Rican business personalities, and here I'm talking about lawyers and accredited professionals, who are even worse than the campesinos that you tried to do business with. The bigger you go, the bigger the rip-off if you do get ripped off.

With that little bit of negative disclosure out of the way oh, we can get now to the task of telling the story of finding our land. There was no great thought process in choosing the province of lamone. It was the only province that fit my budget. The entire project was coming out of my monthly earnings as a senior technical writer at a financial institution in Canada, which, by the way, I did not even know I was working remotely from Costa Rica.
